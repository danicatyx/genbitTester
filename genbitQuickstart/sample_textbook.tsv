 In a class, 40 students visited Nebraska, 30 students visited Ohio, one
student visited both Nebraska and Ohio. How many students visited Nebraska or Ohio
(at least one of these states)?
Solution In problems like this one, we want to avoid counting the same elements twice.
We can write the problem in the language of sets. Let N be the set of students who visited
Nebraska, and let H be the set of students who visited Ohio:
|N| = 40, |H| = 30, |N ∩ H| = 1, |N ∪ H| =?
In each part of the diagram, we write the number of elements, starting with |N ∩ H| = 1. We
write the number that corresponds to the bounded part. The whole oval N has 40 elements.
Thus, the remaining part without the intersection has 40 − 1 = 39 elements. Similarly, the
remaining part of H has 30 − 1 = 29 elements.
Thus, the number of elements of the union N ∪ H is just the sum of numbers in the parts:
|N ∪ H| = 39 + 1 + 29 = 69
Answer: 69 students.
Example 1.24 In a science classroom, 19 students have at least one brother, 15 students have at least one sister, 7 students have at least one brother and at least one
sister, and 6 students do not have any siblings at all. How many students are in the
classroom?
Solution We formulate the problem in the language of sets. Let U be the set of all
students in the class. It is the universal set. Let B be the set of students with at least one
brother, and let S be the set of students with at least one sister. Then, in terms of sets, we
have
|B| = 19, |S| = 15, |B∩S| = 7, |B∪S| = 6 (outside B and S), |U| =?
In each part of the diagram, we write the number of elements, starting from |B∩S| = 7.
